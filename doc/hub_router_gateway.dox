 * @section hub_gateway_introduction Introduction
 * OpenMRN can be used to logically connect two physical network interfaces.
 * The details of this design are ongoing and the documentation will be udated
 * as the design progresses.  The term "bridge" is purposely avoided in this
 * documentation as this can be a rather ambiguous term.
 *
 *
 *
 * @section hub Hub
 * A hub connects two or more physical interfaces through software.  It makes
 * no interpretation of the incoming messages.  A hub simply forwards an
 * incoming message coming in on one segment to all of the other segments
 * participating in the hub.  A hub may connect more than one physical interface
 * type (i.e. CAN, GridConnect over serial or TCP, raw TCP, etc...).  All
 * participants in a hub must have the same abstract protocol (OpenLCB for
 * example).
 *
 *
 *
 * @section router Router
 * A router connects two or more physical interfaces through software.  It can
 * interpret incoming messages from each segment and make an intelligent
 * decision as to which of the other participating segments the message should
 * be forwarded onto.  The decision process can be made based on static routing
 * tables, or based on a learning tree as to what segment a message is
 * destined.  All participants in a router must have the same abstract protocol
 * (OpenLCB for example).
 *
 *
 *
 * @section gateway Gateway
 * A gateway connects exactly two physical interfaces through software.  Unlike
 * a @ref hub or @ref router, a gateway connects two segments with differing
 * abstract protocols.  For example, a gateway can connect an XpressNet segment
 * to an OpenLCB segment.  A translation between the two abstract protocols
 * takes place in the implementation of the gateway.
